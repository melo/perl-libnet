The contents of this directory are not really needed to be able to
use the libnet modules. However if you have a new mib.txt you will
need to convert it to perl before Net::SNMP will be able to use it.

This directory contains a copy of mib.txt that was used to create
the mib information that is in the libnet tree.

To re-create the data in the libnet tree follow these instruction, however I
do not gaurantee that this program will compile on all platforms.

	make MIB_TXT=/path/to/mib.txt
	make dump
	make install
	

parse.c and parse.h were extracted, and modified, from the cmu-snmp-linux-3.2
and contain thier own Copyright.
